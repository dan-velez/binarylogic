Define the language: Decide on the syntax and semantics of the programming language you want to compile. Define the grammar rules and the meaning of valid expressions and statements.

Lexical analysis (Tokenization): Write a lexer (also known as a scanner) to break the source code into tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in the language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

Parsing: Write a parser to analyze the structure of the source code according to the grammar rules of the language. This stage usually involves constructing a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the syntactic structure of the program.

Semantic analysis: Perform semantic analysis to ensure that the program follows the rules and constraints of the language. This includes type checking, scope analysis, and other checks to detect semantic errors.

Intermediate representation (IR): Convert the parse tree or AST into an intermediate representation (IR) that is easier to analyze and manipulate. This IR serves as an intermediate step before generating the target code.

Code generation: Generate the target code for the desired platform (e.g., machine code, bytecode, or intermediate code for a virtual machine). This involves translating the IR into executable instructions or code for the target architecture.

Optimization: Optionally, perform optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and performance of the generated code. This may include optimizations such as constant folding, loop optimization, and register allocation.

Integration and testing: Integrate the compiler components together and thoroughly test the compiler with a variety of test cases to ensure correctness and reliability.

Documentation: Provide documentation for the compiler, including user manuals, language specifications, and implementation details.

Here are some tools and techniques commonly used in compiler development:

Lexer and parser generators: Tools like Lex and Yacc (or their equivalents, Flex and Bison) can automate the generation of lexer and parser code from formal grammar specifications.
Abstract syntax trees (ASTs): ASTs are data structures that represent the syntactic structure of the program. They are often used in compilers for analysis and transformation.
Intermediate representations (IRs): IRs are intermediate languages or representations used within the compiler to facilitate analysis and optimization. Examples include LLVM IR and Java bytecode.
Optimization techniques: Compiler optimizations aim to improve the performance and efficiency of the generated code. Techniques include constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop optimization.
Testing frameworks: Testing is crucial in compiler development to ensure correctness and reliability. Testing frameworks and tools can automate the process of running test cases and comparing the output against expected results.
Writing a compiler is a significant undertaking that requires a solid understanding of programming languages, algorithms, and computer architecture. It's often helpful to start with simpler languages or subsets of languages and gradually build up to more complex features and optimizations. Additionally, studying existing compilers and compiler textbooks can provide valuable insights and guidance in the process.
