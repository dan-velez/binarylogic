# JNeuralNet #
CLI neural net. Train on CLI. Has a Data Scaper.  


## Notes ##
* Neural Network is a graph of **neurons**.
* Neurons are functions with an input and output. Update parameters of a neuron
  to change output.

* A sigmoid function in each neuron. Output between 0 and 1. 
* Final layer generates output. 
* Forward propagation is outputing to each layer foward.
* Final output is the prediction.
* Cost function determines how far the prediction is from the truth.
* Update the parameters to minimize the cost function. This is training. 
* **Gradient Descent** updates the values to minimize cost. 
* Update the weights of each layer to achieve **backpropagation**.

* Each neuron has a **weight** and **bias**.
